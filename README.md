# Memory Game
A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Memory Game is a simple card game, where the objective is matching two pictures together by turning over two cards at a time. 

## Rules of Memory Game
- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert appears that reads "You have found a match" and you get +1 added to your score
- The match cards then disappear
- If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert appears that reads "Sorry, try again"    and the cards flip back
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
